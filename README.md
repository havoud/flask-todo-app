# flask-todo-app

I was eager to learn and have some expriences with Python flask and I got the idea of this project from Integrify company's test assignment.

## To-Do list app for Authenticated Users

Two assignments have been created in this project:

a) creating a user management or user authentication app

b) creating a to do list app for the registered users

You need to sign up and then log in for being able to use the To-Do app.

This application has been created as a test assignment for Integrify company. 

## Deploying the app

Here is the location where I have deployed my [Flask ToDo App](http://hdavoudy.pythonanywhere.com/) on pythonanywhere.com
